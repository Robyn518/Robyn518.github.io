I am a first-year master’s student in Internal Medicine at the Peking University Health Science Center (PUHSC). I am fortunate to be advised by Professor Ji Dong. My current research focuses on imaging diagnosis methods for liver cancer and liver cirrhosis, with the core goal of providing more clinically valuable medical solutions for the early accurate diagnosis and prognosis improvement of these two diseases through technological and methodological innovations.
