I am a first-year Master’s student in Internal Medicine at the Peking University Health Science Center (PUHSC), a leading institution in China’s medical education and clinical research. I feel privileged to be mentored by Professor Ji Dong—whose work in hepatobiliary disease diagnosis and translational medicine has significantly advanced clinical practices for liver-related conditions.

Resaerch Interests
======
My research centers on imaging diagnosis methods for liver cancer and liver cirrhosis; specifically, I am exploring how to integrate quantitative radiological features (e.g., from CT/MRI scans) with machine learning models to enhance the specificity and sensitivity of early-stage lesion detection. Traditional imaging-based diagnosis often relies on subjective visual assessment by radiologists, which can lead to inconsistencies in identifying subtle pathological changes—especially in the early phases of cirrhosis progression, when interventions are most effective.
My core goal is to develop clinically actionable tools: by optimizing feature extraction algorithms and validating models on multi-center patient cohorts (in collaboration with PUHSC-affiliated hospitals), I aim to provide solutions that not only improve the accuracy of early diagnosis but also enable personalized prognosis prediction (e.g., assessing cirrhosis-to-cancer progression risk). This work aligns with my long-term academic interest: bridging medical imaging technology with real-world clinical needs to reduce diagnostic delays and improve patient outcomes in hepatobiliary care.
Beyond research, I am currently involved in a clinical observation project at Peking University First Hospital, where I assist in collecting and annotating imaging data for liver disease patients—this hands-on experience helps me better understand the practical challenges of translating technical innovations into clinical workflows. I also regularly attend seminars on medical artificial intelligence, as I hope to keep pace with interdisciplinary advances that can inform my research.
